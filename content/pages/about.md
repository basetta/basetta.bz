Cucu! My name is Patrick Martini aka Basetta. The moniker Basetta derived from the fact the nature does not donate me sideburns. Sideburns in Italian are basette and basetta is the singular form.

I am a developer using scala most of the time and this is my blog where you'll find my rants and raves. What else ? I have no idea. :D
