Finally, I have the opportunity to see Valentino Rossi.
Today I bought 4 tickets for the MOTOGP in [Brno](http://www.automotodrombrno.cz/).
I'm looking forward going there.


I must wait until 18th August.
I know the fight for the championship is not easy for Valentino who
is dogged by bad luck this year.
But I hope something will happen in Brno... for example Hayden could
forget the fuel or something like that.
