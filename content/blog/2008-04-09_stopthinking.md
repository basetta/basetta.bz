What does "stop thinking" mean ?

It is difficult to answer this question. How can you realize that you have really stopped the compulsory thinking process?

Isn't it true that once you check whether you are thinking or not are, you are
still thinking.

Alas, it seem to be a catch-22 situation.

Lately, I really try to observe my thoughts, in particular those that are putting my mood down.

Observing my thoughts a question arises:

Who is the observer ?

If we cannot identify ourselves with our mind, who are we then ?

And what is the mind ? Why is our life dominated by our mind ?

My answers at that questions are piecemeal for the time being. I hope to find a more complete answer.
